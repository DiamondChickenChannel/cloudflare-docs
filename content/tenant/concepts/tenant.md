# Tenant structure

As a Partner, your account can look a bit different from a normal Cloudflare account.

![Partner accounts contain a tenant, which is a container for customer accounts and zones. For more details, keep reading.](/tenant/static/tenant-diagram.png)

Each partner account contains a Tenant, which allows that account to control and have access to multiple sub-accounts.

Each sub-account can have its own zones, workers, subscriptions, members, and more.
