# Performance

Cloudflare for SaaS facilitates higher performance for custom hostnames within your SaaS zone through the following products:

* [Argo Smart Routing for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-saas/performance/asr-for-saas/) allows you to uniformly increase loading speed for all custom hostnames on your zone.
* [Early Hints for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-saas/performance/early-hints-for-saas/) provides faster loading speeds for individual custom hostnames through [custom metadata](/cloudflare-for-saas/performance/custom-metadata).
* Using a [custom origin server](/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/custom-origins/) increases scalability by allowing you to route traffic from one or more custom hostnames to somewhere other than your default proxy fallback.
