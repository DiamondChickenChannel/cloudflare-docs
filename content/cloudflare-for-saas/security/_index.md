# Security
 
Cloudflare for SaaS provides increased security per custom hostname through:
 
* [Certificate management](/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/), which includes:
    * [Issue and validate certificates](/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/)
    * [Custom certificates](/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/custom-certificates/)
* [TLS settings](/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/enforce-mtls/), which control your trafficâ€™s level of encryption
* [WAF for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-saas/security/waf-for-saas/), which allows you to create and deploy firewall rules, rate limiting rules, and managed rulesets
